      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Tijme and I am a developer. I have been
        passionate about programming since I was eleven years old, and have
        since dedicated my life to mastering the art of coding.
        <br /> <br />
        Aside from programming, I have a love for fitness and sports. I
        regularly hit the gym to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, and
        also enjoy playing korfbal in my free time.
        <br /> <br />
        Although I may be young, I am eager to gain as much experience as
        possible and continue to grow in my career. I am a quick learner and am
        always eager to take on new challenges. I believe that with dedication
        and hard work, I can make my mark in the tech industry and become a
        valuable contributor to any team.
        <br /> <br />
        I am also open to learning from experienced developers and am eager to
        collaborate on projects with others who share my passion for
        programming.
        <br /> <br />
        So if you're looking for a young and motivated developer, look no
        further. I am ready to take on new challenges and gain valuable
        experience while making a positive impact in the tech world.
