      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Tijme and I am a developer. I have been
        passionate about programming since I was eleven years old, and have
        since dedicated my life to mastering the art of coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from programming, I have a love for fitness and sports. I
        regularly hit the gym to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle, and
        also enjoy playing korfbal in my free time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I may be young, I am eager to gain as much experience as
        possible and continue to grow in my career. I am a quick learner and am
        always eager to take on new challenges. I believe that with dedication
        and hard work, I can make my mark in the tech industry and become a
        valuable contributor to any team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also open to learning from experienced developers and am eager to
        collaborate on projects with others who share my passion for
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that working in teams is essential for success and am
        committed to contributing to a positive and productive work environment.
        I have excellent communication skills and am comfortable working with
        colleagues and clients from diverse backgrounds. In my free time, I am
        team captain of my sports team, which has helped me develop strong
        interpersonal skills. I am confident that I can bring these skills to
        any team I work with and contribute to the success of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you're looking for a young and motivated developer, look no
        further. I am ready to take on new challenges and gain valuable
        experience while making a positive impact in the tech world.
